Original README [https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/README.md](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/README.md).

## Why?
I want more readable `heap` viewing for myself, following features are implemented now.  
- more readable `heap` command  
   - changes some `left_arrow` symbol usage  
   - auto `try_free` and `telescope` in `heap` command  
- underline the last 3 nibbles of every addresses  

## TODO

- auto exploit conditions checker
